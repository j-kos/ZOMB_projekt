## Alogorithm
Our filter consists of two main parts:
### FIR filter
It is an adaptive filter with a learning vector of the coefficients based on the LMS algorithm.
#### Reference signals
These are two generated sine and cosine signals with a frequency of 50 Hz, with a constant amplitude and no phase shift.
#### LMS Alogorithm
The LMS algorithm aims to update the FIR filter coefficient vector based on the provided reference signal, feedback signal, learning factor and the current coefficient vector.
#### Mathematical formulas
The gradient descent algorithm can be written as:

The reference signal is:

The filter output is:

### Median filter
Median filter can effectively prevent outburst pulse from interfering.
#### Mathematical formulas
